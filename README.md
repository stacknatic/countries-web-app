### App Background Info

**The original project was cloned from @martin-holland's Country App lesson. Below are the features that I added to it.** 

- Added additional password field (confirmation) to the registration form to ensure that a user doesn't mistakenly register with the wrong password.

- Added password reset link.

- Added logic to remove 'login and register' links if user is logged in.

- Added logic to load a maximum of 20 pages at a time and load more when user scrolls to the bottom of the page. This is to ensure that the page loads fast on first visit. A bootstrap spinner is displayed while more countries are loading.

- Added slides to countriesSingle.jsx (3 images)

- Styled login and registration forms

- Fixed header to top.

- Added footer.
